Go/No Go task for ECoG patients - bear vs. lion 

Some questions:
- Current variable "handedness" asks what hand they are using - are they supposed to use their dominant hand for this task? Would be prefered to use hand that's contralateral to grid placement. 
- I notice that there's some code to output audio- what was this used for and was it useful?
