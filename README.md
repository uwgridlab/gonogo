Go/No Go task for ECoG patients - bear vs. lion 

*Make sure you check the filename variable before you run!*

Some questions:
- Current variable "handedness" asks what hand they are using - are they supposed to use their dominant hand for this task? Would be prefered to use hand that's contralateral to grid placement. 
- I notice that there's some code to output audio- what was this used for and was it useful?
- TODO: make ratio of go-no go adjustable ~ line 146
- TODO: make the filename variable easier to work with - have user navigate to directory where they want their data to be dumped - allows for matlab code + data separation
